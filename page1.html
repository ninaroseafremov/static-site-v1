  <h1>Nina's Digital Literacy Narrative</h1>
<h3>Hello, everyone!</h1>
<p>Growing up, I wouldn’t say that I had the most exposure to the digital world as I imagine others my age did. Both of my parents are boomers and while my mom tries to build her digital literacy, my dad is a complete technophobe. To this day, my dad still doesn’t even know how to text! It's fair to say that everything I know, which is fairly limited, I learned when left to my own devices. That's not to say I lived in a home entirely without technology. I’d say my first experiences with technology, beyond watching TV, were surfing the web on the PC desktop in our basement and playing Nintendo DS. I specifically remember going to pick out my Nintendo and having my heart set on the pink one. Without my Nintendo DS, I would have never discovered how life changing Animal Crossing is and how thrilling it is to connect with other players, friends and strangers alike, in a multiplayer setting. Simply put, technology was also about making connections with others. As for my first experiences on the Web, it would have been much later before I would have understood the power of internet culture if I wasn't afforded the opportunity to explore it at a young age, which I think is an important part of my generation's consciousness.</p>
<p> Besides that, my digital literacy progression was minimal until 8th grade when the school I was attending lent out Apple Laptops to all the 8th graders. This was pivotal for me. I learned how to research better using the internet, how to use Microsoft Office applications, and my video editing skills vastly improved from my days of shooting “movies” on Photobooth with my friends. While my teachers gave me and my peers instructions and tutorials, back then I felt it more useful to learn things by messing around and experimenting on my own with all the software and applications at my fingertips. That year gave me new confidence and taught me that I could always figure things out if put the time into it </p>
<p>That same year, I also made a Facebook, which would be the beginning of my social media saga. Since then, it seems like I’ve used almost every social media app under the sun whether for marketing purposes or for pleasure. Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Reddit, Telegram, Snapchat, and Linkedin; you name it! As far as my digital literacy goes, I feel most confident with social media. I even have Russian social media accounts, like Vkontakte. Speaking of the Russian Web, I’ve made use of Russian search engines for research and translation reasons and have also acquainted myself with Russian internet culture to keep up with trends and memes over there.</p>
