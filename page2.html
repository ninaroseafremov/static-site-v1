  <h1>Nina's Digital Literacy Narrative</h1>
<h2>21st Century Writing</h2>
<p>As far as writing goes in the 21st century, it doesn’t seem like simply knowing how to write well is enough. Writing involves distribution and layout of the text, which now takes on a digital form more often than not. From my nonacademic and nonexpert observations, despite all this, I don’t think not knowing these skills will make you completely unmarketable when looking for a job. After speaking with one of my professors last year, I learned that having a sound understanding of the theory of rhetoric is still a super important skill that employers seek in technical writers. It's still great, though, to be well versed in other mediums of communication, such as visual communication, which comes up often in my coursework. Visual communication subtlety communicates themes and ideas through color, font, layout, images etc. Visual communication goes in tandem with digital technologies; visuals make websites, various platforms, and apps more user friendly. Instagram, for example, is a social media platform where the primary mode of communication is visual. However, visual communicaton cannot encompass every ounce of information neccesary to convey complex and nuanced themes. Nevertheless, digital literacy and understanding of other modes of communication provide the writer with more opportunities for growth within a company due to having the skillset to take on more tasks. Additionally, having the ability to write with digital technologies lends freelance writers more independence and more opportunties when seeking projects.</p>
<p>As a technical writing student, I often find myself thinking about which digital technologies will be useful for me to have a sound understanding of before graduation. I want to feel comfortable with HTML and CSS, with Adobe Indesign and Illustrator, and with making a visually appealing website. It seems to me that this will be a substantial start when entering the job market a year and half from now.</p>
