<p>Above, you can see my Personal Learning Network (PLN) for digital literacy. It is essentially all of the resources I have available to me currently that I can turn to for help while reaching my digital literacy goals. The major points of my PLN include people I know, video resources, other digital sources, the university, and books. Some of these I actively use or have used in the past. I most often turn to video tutorials to help me with new software and I used to watch the CrashCourse playlist for computer science. I also dive headfirst into my coursework when new opportunities to develop my digital literacy arise. I was also recently exploring the IT @ UMN website and it looks like I can find great resources there, too, to learn new things. Some of the things listed in my PLN are new resources to me, such as tech-related podcasts and some of the websites I’ve listed. I'll keep exploring resources in that realm and eventually add them to my PLN. Additionally, I am open to reading books that could help develop my digital literacy. I am open to any recommendations! One of the most important aspects of my PLN is the people I know who can help me. As amazing as video tutorials are, nothing compares to having someone help you with specific questions in live time.</p>
<p>I’m excited to more actively explore my PLN and see where it takes me this semester and in the future.</p>
